<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Aminu Abba, a passionate and driven individual with a strong foundation in Accounting and a deep interest in Management and Business Strategy. I hold a degree in Accounting and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Management at the National College of Ireland. My journey so far has been shaped by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous growth both personally and professionally.
</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve developed an appreciation for how numbers, strategy, and innovation connect to build stronger organizations. My academic and professional experiences have taught me the importance of structure, precision, and adaptability qualities that I carry into every project I work on. I’m particularly interested in how management principles can be combined with technology to improve business operations and decision-making.

<p>Beyond academics, I’ve been exploring the world of web development and digital tools, learning how technology can simplify processes and open new opportunities for creativity. I enjoy experimenting with ideas that bridge finance, management, and technology because I believe the future belongs to people who can connect different fields to solve real problems.
Outside of work and study, I’m someone who values discipline and balance. I go to the gym regularly, enjoy exploring new ideas, and love connecting with people who share a passion for growth and innovation. My goal is simple to keep learning, keep building, and make a lasting impact wherever I go.</p>
